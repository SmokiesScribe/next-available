/* 
 * CSS Variables for BuddyClients Plugin
 * 
 * This file contains CSS variables (custom properties) used throughout the BuddyClients plugin.
 * 
 * Some variables are dynamically injected through the AssetManager in PHP using the `wp_add_inline_style` function.
 * This allows values like colors to be customized through the plugin settings in WordPress.
 * 
 * Ensure that any updates to dynamic variables align with the PHP implementation in the AssetManager.
 * 
 * @since 1.0.20
